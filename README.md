## Overview

AUSee is built on Django and follows a decentralized, community-driven approach. Itâ€™s developed by students for students, ensuring that every voice is heard without centralizing the power to moderate content.

---

## Our Mission

We believe that **shared knowledge and experiences** can help the student community. By maintaining anonymity, we encourage openness and honest feedback while fostering a respectful and constructive environment. AUSee is built on the principle of a **horizontal, decentralized structure** where all students can actively participate in adding and moderating courses and reviews. Our goal is to create an anarchic, self-governing space where students **collectively maintain the platform**, ensuring **transparency** and inclusivity in course evaluations. We discourage features that centralize the power to moderate content.&#x20;

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before setting up AUSee locally, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.8 or later**
- **Git**
- **pip (Python package manager)**
- **Virtualenv** (optional but recommended)
- **PostgreSQL**

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ausee.git
   cd ausee
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  # Create the virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate on Linux/Mac
   # For Windows:
   # venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database:**
   Run migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser to see the site.

### Local Setup

Follow these steps to configure and run the project locally with your custom environment settings:

1. **Create a Local `.env` File in the Project Root:**
   ```bash
   touch .env
   nano .env
   ```
   Add the following environment variables:
   ```plaintext
   DEBUG=True
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/ausee_db
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
   ```

2. **Create a Local PostgreSQL Database:**
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql
   CREATE DATABASE ausee_db;
   CREATE USER your_username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
   ALTER ROLE your_username SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
   ALTER ROLE your_username SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
   ALTER ROLE your_username SET timezone TO 'UTC';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ausee_db TO your_username;
   \q
   ```

3. **(Re)Create and Activate the Virtual Environment (if not already done):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a Superuser:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Collect Static Files:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

8. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   Your site should now be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

### Testing the Setup

1. **Admin Interface:**  
   Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) and log in with your superuser credentials.

2. **Create a Course:**  
   Use the admin interface to create a course.

3. **View Courses:**  
   Check that the course appears at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/).

**Common Issues to Watch Out For:**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
- Verify that your database credentials in `.env` match those created in your PostgreSQL setup.
- For static file errors, confirm that `DEBUG=True` in your local environment.
